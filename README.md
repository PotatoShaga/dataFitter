This is a streamlit app which takes in data either manually or by a csv, and then graphs it in one of 4 graphs (linear, polynomial, expontential, and logarithmic) or one of 2 distributions (normal and exponential distribution). 
The information is fit on the graph, and information about the curve's equation/accuracy is provided. The app fits the data with numpy and scipys functions and then graphs it using matplotlib. The code can be run by typing "streamlit run app.py" into your console.
